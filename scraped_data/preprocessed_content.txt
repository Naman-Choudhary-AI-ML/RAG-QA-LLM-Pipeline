content from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pittsburgh: pittsburgh (/ˈpɪtsbɜːrɡ/ pits-burg) is a city in and the county seat of allegheny county, pennsylvania, united states. it is the second-most populous city in pennsylvania, after philadelphia, and the 68th-most populous city in the u.s., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. the city is located in southwestern pennsylvania at the confluence of the allegheny river and the monongahela river, which combine to form the ohio river. [7] it anchors the pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the ohio valley and appalachia, the second-largest in pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the u.s. pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater pittsburgh–weirton–steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of ohio and west virginia. pittsburgh is known as "the steel city" for its dominant role in the history of the u.s. steel industry.
[8] it developed as a vital link of the atlantic coast and midwest, as the mineral-rich allegheny mountains led to the region being contested by the french and british empires, virginians, whiskey rebels, and civil war raiders. [9] for part of the 20th century, pittsburgh was behind only new york city and chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most u.s. stockholders per capita. [10] deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city. [11] however, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries. [12][13] pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the university of pittsburgh medical center, allegheny health network, and 68 colleges and universities, including research and development leaders carnegie mellon university and the university of pittsburgh.
[14] the area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy. [15] in the private sector, pittsburgh-based pnc is the nation's fifth-largest bank, and the city is home to ten fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 u.s. law firms. other corporations that have regional headquarters and offices have helped pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for u.s. job growth. [16] pittsburgh is sometimes called the "city of bridges" for its 446 bridges. [8] its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the carnegie museums of pittsburgh, pittsburgh parks conservancy, pittsburgh zoo & aquarium, phipps conservatory and botanical gardens, the national aviary, and a diverse cultural district.
[17] the city's major league professional sports teams include the pittsburgh steelers, pittsburgh penguins, and pittsburgh pirates. pittsburgh is additionally where jehovah's witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 g20 pittsburgh summit. pittsburgh was named in 1758, by general john forbes, in honor of british statesman william pitt, 1st earl of chatham. as forbes was a scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ pits-bər-ə (similar to edinburgh). [18][19] pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on april 22, 1794, with the following act:[20] "be it enacted by the pennsylvania state senate and pennsylvania house of representatives of the commonwealth of pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of pittsburgh for ever.
"[21] from 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as "pittsburg", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations. [22][18] after a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed. [18] the pittsburg press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921. [23] kingdom of france 1690s–1763 great britain 1681–1781 united states 1776–present the area of the ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the shawnee and several other settled groups of native americans. [24] shannopin's town was an 18th-century lenape (delaware) town located roughly from where penn avenue is today, below the mouth of two mile run, from 30th street to 39th street.
according to george croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as washington's landing, formerly herr's island, in what is now the lawrenceville neighborhood. [25]: 289 the first known european to enter the region was the french explorer robert de la salle from quebec during his 1669 expedition down the ohio river. [26][better source needed] european pioneers, primarily dutch, followed in the early 18th century. michael bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year european fur traders established area posts and settlements. [27] in 1749, french soldiers from quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite canada with french louisiana via the rivers.
[27] during 1753–1754, the british hastily built fort prince george before a larger french force drove them off. the french built fort duquesne based on lasalle's 1669 claims. the french and indian war, the north american front of the seven years' war, began with the future pittsburgh as its center. british general edward braddock was dispatched with major george washington as his aide to take fort duquesne. [28] the british and colonial force were defeated at braddock's field.
general john forbes finally took the forks in 1758. he began construction on fort pitt, named after william pitt the elder, while the settlement was named "pittsborough". [29] during pontiac's war, a loose confederation of native american tribes laid siege to fort pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after colonel henry bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the battle of bushy run. bouquet strengthened the defenses of fort pitt the next year. [30][31][32][33] during this period, the powerful nations of the iroquois confederacy, based in new york, had maintained control of much of the ohio valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. by the terms of the 1768 treaty of fort stanwix, the penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the iroquois.
a 1769 survey referenced the future city as the "manor of pittsburgh". [34] both the colony of virginia and the province of pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the mason–dixon line westward, placing pittsburgh in pennsylvania. on march 8, 1771, bedford county, pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. on april 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as pitt township. [35][36] william teagarden was the first constable, and william troop was the first clerk.
[37] following the american revolution, the village of pittsburgh continued to grow. one of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the ohio country. in 1784, thomas vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the penn family attorney. pittsburgh became a possession of pennsylvania in 1785. the following year, the pittsburgh post-gazette was started, and in 1787, the pittsburgh academy was chartered. unrest during the whiskey rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area.
by 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. settlers arrived after crossing the appalachian mountains or through the great lakes. fort pitt (now pittsburgh) at the source of the ohio river became the main base for settlers moving into the northwest territory. the federal government recognizes pittsburgh as the starting point for the lewis and clark expedition. [38] preparations began in pittsburgh in 1803 when meriwether lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the missouri river. [39] the war of 1812 cut off the supply of british goods, stimulating american industry.
by 1815, pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. on march 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. it was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. in the 1830s, many welsh people from the merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the merthyr rising. by the 1840s, pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the allegheny mountains.
the great fire of pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. the city rebuilt with the aid of irish immigrants who came to escape the great famine. by 1857, pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of european immigrants to the area, with the most coming from germany. because pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the revolution, enslaved african americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the south, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. there were active stations of the underground railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and african-american workers in city hotels.
the drennen slave girl walked out of the monongahela house in 1850, apparently to freedom. [40] the merchant's hotel was also a place where african-american workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the underground railroad. [41] sometimes refugee slaves from the south stayed in pittsburgh, but other times they continued north, including into canada. many slaves left the city and county for canada after congress passed the 1850 fugitive slave act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. from 1850 to 1860, the black population in allegheny county dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in canada.
[40] the american civil war boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the union. andrew carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the edgar thomson steel works in north braddock, pennsylvania, which evolved into the carnegie steel company. he adopted the bessemer process to increase production. manufacturing was key to growth of pittsburgh and the surrounding region. railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.
in 1901, j. p. morgan and attorney elbert h. gary merged carnegie steel company and several other companies into u.s. steel. by 1910, pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output. the pittsburgh agreement was subscribed in may 1918 between the czech and slovak nationalities, as envisioned by t. g. masaryk, concerning the future foundation of czechoslovakia. [43] the city suffered severe flooding in march 1936. the city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous european immigrants to its industrial jobs. by 1940, non-hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.
[44] pittsburgh also became a main destination of the african-american great migration from the rural south during the first half of the 20th century. [45] limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers. [46] during world war ii, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort. [29] this resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. the city's reputation as the "arsenal of democracy"[47][48] was being overshadowed by james parton's 1868 observation of pittsburgh being "hell with the lid off.
"[49] following world war ii, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "renaissance," cleaning up the air and the rivers. the "renaissance ii" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. the industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. there were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures. [11] in the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics.
although pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. while 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again. during the late 2000s recession, pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. it was one of the few cities in the united states to see housing property values rise. between 2006 and 2011, the pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (msa) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the united states, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.
[50] in september 2009, the 2009 g20 pittsburgh summit was held in pittsburgh. [51] pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. the 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown. the city is on the allegheny plateau, within the ecoregion of the western allegheny plateau. [52] the downtown area (also known as the golden triangle) sits where the allegheny river flows from the northeast and the monongahela river from the southeast to form the ohio river.
the convergence is at point state park and is referred to as "the point." the city extends east to include the oakland and shadyside sections, which are home to the university of pittsburgh, carnegie mellon university, chatham university, carnegie museum and library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. the southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential. many pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. more than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to "hills," "heights," or similar features.
[a] the steps of pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. they include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks. [53] many provide vistas of the pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers. [54] bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. the great allegheny passage and chesapeake and ohio canal towpath connect the city directly to downtown washington, d.c. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.
the city consists of the downtown area, called the golden triangle,[55] and four main areas surrounding it. these surrounding areas are subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (pittsburgh has 90 neighborhoods). [56] relative to downtown, these areas are known as the central, north side/north hills, south side/south hills, east end, and west end. downtown pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine of which top 500 feet (150 m). the u.s. steel tower is the tallest, at 841 ft (256 m).
[57] the cultural district consists of a 14-block area of downtown along the allegheny river. this district contains many theaters and arts venues and is home to a growing residential segment. most significantly, the pittsburgh cultural trust is embarking on riverparc, a four-block mixed-use "green" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers of between 20 and 30 stories. the firstside portion of downtown borders the monongahela river, the historic mon wharf and hosts the distinctive ppg place gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. new condo towers have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use, increasing 24-hour residents.
downtown is served by the port authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south. [58] it is also home to point park university and duquesne university which borders uptown. the north side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. the area was once known as allegheny city and operated as its own independent city until 1907, when it was merged with pittsburgh despite great protest from its citizens. the north side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for its well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes.
many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. the north side is also home to attractions such as acrisure stadium, pnc park, kamin science center, national aviary, andy warhol museum, mattress factory art museum, children's museum of pittsburgh, randyland, penn brewery, allegheny observatory, and allegheny general hospital. [59] the south side was once the site of railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. starting in the late 20th century, the city undertook a main street program in cooperation with the national trust for historic preservation, encouraging design and landscape improvements on east carson street, and supporting new retail. the area has become a local pittsburgher destination, and the value of homes in the south side had increased in value by about 10% annually for the 10 years leading up to 2014.
[60] east carson street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues. in 1993, the urban redevelopment authority of pittsburgh purchased the south side works steel mill property. it collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development that included a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor practice fields for the pittsburgh steelers and pitt panthers. construction of the development began in 1998. the southside works has been open since 2005, featuring many stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for american eagle outfitters. [61] the east end of pittsburgh is home to the university of pittsburgh, carnegie mellon university, carlow university, chatham university, the carnegie institute's museums of art and natural history, phipps conservatory, and soldiers and sailors memorial hall.
it is also home to many parks and public spaces including mellon park, westinghouse park, schenley park, frick park, the frick pittsburgh, bakery square, and the pittsburgh zoo and ppg aquarium. the neighborhoods of shadyside and squirrel hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods with some apartments and condos, and pedestrian-oriented shopping/business districts. squirrel hill is also known as the hub of jewish life in pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues. [62] oakland, heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, and the petersen events center. the strip district to the west along the allegheny river is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night.
bloomfield is pittsburgh's little italy and is known for its italian restaurants and grocers. lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. the hill district was home to photographer charles harris as well as various african-american jazz clubs. [63] other east end neighborhoods include point breeze, regent square, highland park, homewood, lincoln-lemington-belmar, larimer, east hills, east liberty, polish hill, hazelwood, garfield, morningside, and stanton heights. the west end includes mt.
washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as sheraden and elliott. many of pittsburgh's patchwork of neighborhoods still retain ethnic characters reflecting the city's settlement history. these include: several neighborhoods on the edges of the city are less urban, featuring tree-lined streets, yards and garages, with a more suburban character. oakland, the south side, the north side, and the golden triangle are characterized by more density of housing, walking neighborhoods, and a more diverse, urban feel. pittsburgh falls within the borders of the northeastern united states as defined by multiple us government agencies.
pittsburgh is the principal city of the pittsburgh combined statistical area, a combined statistical area defined by the u.s. census bureau. pittsburgh falls within the borders of appalachia as defined by the appalachian regional commission, and has long been characterized as the "northern urban industrial anchor of appalachia. "[66] in its post-industrial state, pittsburgh has been characterized as the "paris of appalachia",[67][68][69][70] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in appalachia. under the köppen climate classification, pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (dfa) if the 0 °c (32 °f) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (cfa) if the −3 °c (27 °f) isotherm is used. summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature.
despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the u.s.[71][72][73] the city lies in the usda plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a. [74] the area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. as measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major us cities at well under 50%. [75] the warmest month of the year in pittsburgh is july, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °f (22.9 °c). conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °f (32 °c) on an average 9.5 days a year,[76] a considerable heat index arises.
the coolest month is january, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °f (−1.8 °c), and lows of 0 °f (−18 °c) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year. [76] officially, record temperatures range from −22 °f (−30 °c), on january 19, 1994 to 103 °f (39 °c), which occurred three times, most recently on july 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °f (−19 °c), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °f (28 °c) on july 1, 1901. [76][b] due to elevation and location on the windward side of the appalachian mountains, 100 °f (38 °c)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on july 15, 1995. [76] average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in may while least in october; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018. [77] on average, december and january have the greatest number of precipitation days.
snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51. [78] there is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy. [79] in terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, pittsburgh (45%) is similar to seattle (49%). the american lung association's (ala) 2023 “state of the air” report (which included data from 2019 to 2021) showed air quality in pittsburgh improving. the city received a passing grade for ozone pollution, going from an f to a c grade, and improving from the 46th to 54th most polluted by ozone smog.
[83] according to daily ozone air quality data provided by the epa, from 2021 to 2024, pittsburgh had good or moderate air quality most of the time. [84][85] then-allegheny county executive rich fitzgerald said in december 2023 that they’d seen an “80 % drop in hazardous air pollutants” and that they made epa attainment at all eight county air monitors for the first time in 2020, and then also achieved that goal in 2021, 2022, and were on track for better results in 2023. [86] a past 2019 "state of the air" report from the american lung association (ala) found that air quality in the pittsburgh-new castle-weirton, pa-oh-wv metro area worsened compared to previous reports, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. in 2019, outside of california, allegheny county was the only county in the united states that recorded failing grades for all three. [87] in a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the united states, the american lung association ranked only six u.s. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven u.s. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than pittsburgh.
for ozone (smog) pollution, pittsburgh was ranked 24th among u.s. metro areas. [88][89] the area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. the ala's rankings have been disputed by the allegheny county health department (achd), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ala, without any context or averaging. the lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to u.s. steel's clairton coke works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey. [90] the region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from ohio and west virginia.
[91] although the county was still below the "pass" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999. [92] achd spokesman guillermo cole stated "it's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... we've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more. "[93] as of 2005, the city includes 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets. a 2011 analysis of pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality.
energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. the city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance. [94] despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. in a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average. [95] the study also found that 38% of students live in areas over usepa's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the who's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter.
[95] several of the plants were located in or very near pittsburgh. [95] the study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities. [95] this had led some residents in pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism. [96] groups such as women for a healthy environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in pittsburgh. [97] whe does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education.
[97] in the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, smell pgh, was launched. as air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities. [98] the local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding epa limits. [99] this is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater.
the pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959. [100] due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water. [101] as little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers. [102] nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and clean water act violations. [103] the local sewage authority, allegheny county sanitary authority, or alcosan, is operating under consent decree from the epa to come up with solutions.
[104] in 2017, alcosan proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the epa in 2019. [105][106] pittsburgh water and sewer authority (pwsa) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. they have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement. [107] in 2017, mayor william peduto advocated for a restructuring of the pwsa and a partially privatized water authority. [108] governor wolf subsequently assigned the pwsa to be under the oversight of the public utilities commission (puc).
[107] pwsa has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in pittsburgh's drinking water. [109] although pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame pwsa administrative changes for the spike in lead levels. [110] in the years prior, pwsa had hired veolia, a paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties. [111] by 2015, pwsa in consultation with veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality. [111] simultaneously, pwsa in consultation with veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014,[110] from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with department of environmental protection.
[112] anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water. [112] in 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. the legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water. [112] though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit. [110] in late 2015 pwsa terminated its contracted with veolia.
[111] in response to the high lead levels pwsa began adding orthophosphate to the water. [113] orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water. [113] pwsa has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead. [113] there remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system. [114] some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and hispanic children in pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.
[114] water fountains in langley k-8 school in sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the pittsburgh area. these levels were about 11 times the legal limit. some residents believe this is due to langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program. [115] at the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was white, 25.8% black or african american, 0.2% american indian and alaska native, 4.4% asian, 0.3% other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of pittsburgh's population was of hispanic or latino american origin of any race. non-hispanic whites were 64.8% of the population in 2010,[119] compared to 78.7% in 1970.
[120] by the 2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971. [118] its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-hispanic white, 23.0% black or african american, 5.8% asian, and 3.2% hispanic or latino american of any race. since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest european ethnic groups in pittsburgh were german (19.7%), irish (15.8%), italian (11.8%), polish (8.4%), and english (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% german-american, 15.4% italian american and 11.6% irish american. pittsburgh has one of the largest italian-american communities in the nation,[126] and the fifth-largest ukrainian community per the 1990 census. [127] pittsburgh has one of the most extensive croatian communities in the united states.
[128] overall, the pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of slavic americans in the country. pittsburgh has a sizable black and african american population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the east end. there is also a small asian community consisting of indian immigrants, and a small hispanic community consisting of mexicans and puerto ricans. [129] according to a 2010 association of religion data archives (arda) study, residents include 773,341 "catholics"; 326,125 "mainline protestants"; 174,119 "evangelical protestants;" 20,976 "black protestants;" and 16,405 "orthodox christians," with 996,826 listed as "unclaimed" and 16,405 as "other" in the metro area. [129] a 2017 study by the cohen center for modern jewish studies at brandeis university estimated the jewish population of greater pittsburgh was 49,200.
[130] pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor to jehovah's witnesses was founded by charles taze russell; today the denomination makes up approximately 1% of the population based on data from the pew research center. [131][132] according to a 2014 study by the pew research center, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered protestant, and 32% professing catholic beliefs. while 18% claim no religious affiliation. the same study says that other religions (including judaism, buddhism, islam, and hinduism) collectively make up about 4% of the population. [133] in 2010, there were 143,739 households, out of which 21.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.2% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4% were non-families.
39.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. the average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. in the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. the median age was 36 years. for every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. for every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.
the median income for a household in the city was $28,588, and the median income for a family was $38,795. males had a median income of $32,128 versus $25,500 for females. the per capita income for the city was $18,816. about 15.0% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.5% of those under the age of 18 and 13.5% ages 65 or older. by the 2019 american community survey, the median income for a household increased to $53,799.
[134] families had a median income of $68,922; married-couple families had a median income of $93,500; and non-family households had a median income of $34,448. pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs within city limits are squirrel hill and point breeze, the only two areas of the city which have average household incomes over $100,000 a year. outside of city limits, sewickley heights is by a wide margin the wealthiest suburb of pittsburgh within allegheny county, with an average yearly household income of just over $218,000. sewickely heights is seen as one of pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs culturally as well, titles which the suburbs of upper st. clair, fox chapel, wexford, and warrendale also have been bestowed. [135][136] in a 2002 study, pittsburgh ranked 22nd of 69 urban places in the u.s. in the number of residents 25 years or older who had completed a bachelor's degree, at 31%.
[137] pittsburgh ranked 15th of the 69 places in the number of residents 25 years or older who completed a high school degree, at 84.7%. [138] the metro area has shown greater residential racial integration during the last 30 years. the 2010 census ranked 18 other u.s. metros as having greater black-white segregation, while 32 other u.s. metros rank higher for black-white isolation. [139] as of 2018, much of pittsburgh's population density was concentrated in the central, southern, and eastern areas. the city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile; its most densely populated parts are north oakland (at 21,200 per square mile) and uptown pittsburgh (at 19,869 per square mile).
outside of the city limits, dormont and mount oliver are pittsburgh's most densely-populated neighborhoods, with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively. [140] most of pittsburgh's immigrants are from china, india, korea and italy. [141] since the 1940s, some demographic changes have sometimes been caused by city initiatives for redevelopment. throughout the 1950s pittsburgh's lower hill district faced massive demographic changes when 1,551, majority black, residents and 413 businesses were forced to relocate when the city of pittsburgh used eminent domain to make space for the construction of the civic arena. [13] this civic arena ultimately opened in 1961.
[13] the civic arena was built as part of one of pittsburgh's revitalization campaigns. an auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the regional planning association and urban redevelopment authority. the idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the pittsburgh civic light opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the allegheny conference on community redevelopment. the following year the public auditorium authority of pittsburgh and allegheny county was formed. the lower hill district had been approved by the city planning commission in 1950.
[13] partially as a result of the civic arena, the whole hill district is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now. [142] these governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the civic arena. [13] in the 1960s the urban redevelopment authority attempted to redevelop east liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. penn center mall was the result of this effort. in the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate.
this proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes. [143] later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into east liberty, such as home depot, whole foods, and google, created another demographic shift. this era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “florida’s creative class.” this change continued to be supported by the urban redevelopment authority; particularly by the executive director rob stepney, who said of the redevelopment “we had an inspired and shared vision.” when describing the result of redevelopment he said “east liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”[143] the pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. in one article published in public source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place. [142] others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification.
[144] gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. this displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. in east liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. for example, when the east mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a target built in its place. [145] pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries.
the region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,[146] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies. [147] a national bureau of economic research 2014 report named pittsburgh the second-best u.s. city for intergenerational economic mobility[148] or the american dream. [149] reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 nabisco factory, a complex known as bakery square.
[150] some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots. [151] pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as "the poster child for managing industrial transition". [152] other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base. [153] the largest employer in the city is the university of pittsburgh medical center, with 48,000 employees. all hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs in the region.
an analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: "that's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s. "[154] education is a major economic driver in the region. the largest single employer in education is the university of pittsburgh, with 10,700 employees. [155] ten fortune 500 companies call the pittsburgh area home.

[246] in pittsburgh, the homicide rate for african americans is seven times the national average. [247] some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates. [247] there is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim.
[248] this has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic. [248] this is despite an increasing police budget. in 2023, members of the pittsburgh city council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million. [249] about 6% of this money is expected to go to the stop the violence trust fund. this fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of community health and safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in pittsburgh.

other airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include morgantown municipal airport (79 miles (127 km) south of pittsburgh), youngstown–warren regional airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of pittsburgh), akron–canton airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of pittsburgh), johnstown–cambria county airport (60 miles (97 km) east of pittsburgh) and erie international airport (123 miles (198 km) north of pittsburgh). amtrak provides intercity rail service to pittsburgh union station, via the capitol limited between chicago and washington, d.c., and the pennsylvanian to new york city. megabus, greyhound lines, and fullington trailways connect pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; greyhound and fullington trailways buses stop at the grant street transportation center intercity bus terminal. popular destinations include philadelphia, new york city, and washington, d.c.[305] until declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served pittsburgh: baltimore & ohio station, pittsburgh & lake erie railroad station, wabash pittsburgh terminal and pittsburgh union station. pittsburgh regional transit, formerly known as the port authority of allegheny county, is the region's mass transit system.
while serving only a portion of the pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the united states. [306] pittsburgh regional transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the monongahela incline funicular railway (more commonly known as an "incline") on mount washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems. [307] pittsburgh regional transit owns the duquesne incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[308] but accepts pittsburgh regional transit passes and charges prt fares. the bus system lines are labeled by number and letter. these are the largest portion of pittsburgh regional transit and serve on streets and designated busways.
buses serve most of the county, extending as far as pittsburgh international airport, monroeville, mccandless, and the borders of westmoreland county and beaver county, pennsylvania. meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the "t") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. the light rail runs from acrisure stadium to south hills village and library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves castle shannon, mt. lebanon, and beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through overbrook. pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the pennsylvania railroad first opened service between the pittsburgh and philadelphia.
the baltimore and ohio railroad entered the city in 1871. in 1865, andrew carnegie opened the pittsburgh locomotive and car works, which manufactured for the industry until 1919. carnegie also founded the union railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while george westinghouse's wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869. pittsburgh is home to one of norfolk southern railway's busiest freight corridors, the pittsburgh line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. the suburban conway rail yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. csx, the other major freight railroad in the eastern u.s., also has major operations around pittsburgh. the port of pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the united states with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked ninth-largest in the u.s. when measured in domestic trade. [309] pittsburgh's sister cities are:[310] content from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_page: takin' it back is the fifth major-label studio album by american singer-songwriter meghan trainor.
epic records released it on october 21, 2022. trainor worked with producers including federico vindver and gian stone and featured artists like teddy swims and natti natasha. inspired by the sound of her album title (2015) after its title track went viral on tiktok, takin' it back is a doo-wop and bubblegum-pop album about motherhood and self-acceptance. trainor promoted the latter with televised performances and two singles, "bad for me" and "made you look". the latter peaked at number 11 in the us and reached the top 10 in several other countries. reviewers thought takin' it back showcased trainor's maturity, growth, and musicality, but they were divided on whether it was a progression from her earlier work.
the album debuted at number 16 on the us billboard 200. its deluxe edition was supported by the single "mother". (this article is part of two featured topics: takin' it back and meghan trainor albums.) october 21 the 2017 american animated fantasy comedy-drama film coco won 63 awards from 81 nominations. produced by pixar animation studios and released by walt disney pictures, the film got particular recognition for its score, composed by michael giacchino (pictured). at the 90th academy awards, coco won best animated feature and best original song.
the film garnered two nominations at the 75th golden globe awards, winning for best animated feature film. coco also won the bafta award for best animated film and the critics' choice movie award for both best animated feature and best song. it was named one of the ten best films of 2017 by the national board of review. (full list...) x-rays are a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, with wavelengths shorter than those of ultraviolet rays and longer than those of gamma rays – roughly in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometres. x-rays were discovered by german scientist wilhelm röntgen in 1895, who named them x-radiation to signify an unknown type of radiation.
x-rays can penetrate many solid substances such as construction materials and living tissue, and x-ray radiography is widely used in medical diagnostics. this medical significance was noticed by röntgen shortly after he discovered x-rays; this print, titled hand mit ringen (hand with rings), is a print of his first medical x-ray, taken of his wife anna bertha ludwig's hand in december 1895. print credit: wilhelm röntgen; restored by yann forget wikipedia is written by volunteer editors and hosted by the wikimedia foundation, a non-profit organization that also hosts a range of other volunteer projects: this wikipedia is written in english. many other wikipedias are available; some of the largest are listed below. content from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:contents: explore the vast knowledge of wikipedia through these helpful resources. if you have a specific topic in mind, use wikipedia's search box.

content from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_pittsburgh: the history of pittsburgh began with centuries of native american civilization in the modern pittsburgh region, known as jaödeogë’ in the seneca language. [1] eventually, european explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the allegheny and monongahela rivers meet to form the ohio, which leads to the mississippi river. the area became a battleground when france and great britain fought for control in the 1750s. when the british were victorious, the french ceded control of territories east of the mississippi. following american independence in 1783, the village around fort pitt continued to grow.
the region saw the short-lived whiskey rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. the war of 1812 cut off the supply of british goods, stimulating american manufacture. by 1815, pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. by the 1840s, pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the allegheny mountains. production of steel began in 1875. during the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer.
workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. forty men were killed, most of them strikers. by 1911, pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. pittsburgh was a republican party stronghold until 1932. the soaring unemployment of the great depression, the new deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the new deal coalition under powerful democratic mayors. in world war ii, it was the center of the "arsenal of democracy", producing munitions for the allied war effort as prosperity returned.
following world war ii, pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "renaissance." the industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. in 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. the population of the pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of european descent and 35% are minorities.
for thousands of years, native americans inhabited the region where the allegheny and the monongahela join to form the ohio. paleo-indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. meadowcroft rockshelter, an archaeological site west of pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first americans lived in the region from that date. [2] during the adena culture that followed, mound builders erected a large indian mound at the future site of mckees rocks, about three miles (5 km) from the head of the ohio. the indian mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the hopewell culture.
[3] by 1700 the haudenosaunee, the five nations-based south of the great lakes in present-day new york, held dominion over the upper ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. other tribes included the lenape, who had been displaced from eastern pennsylvania by european settlement, and the shawnee, who had migrated up from the south. [4] with the arrival of european explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity. [5] in 1748, when conrad weiser visited logstown, 18 miles (29 km) downriver from pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the iroquois included 163 seneca, 74 mohawk, 35 onondaga, 20 cayuga, and 15 oneida. other tribes were 165 lenape, 162 shawnee, 100 wyandot, 40 tisagechroami, and 15 mohican.
[6] shannopin's town, a lenape (delaware) village on the east bank of the allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. the village is believed to have been roughly from where penn avenue is today, below the mouth of two mile run, from 30th street to 39th street. according to george croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as herr's island, in what is now the lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of pittsburgh. [7]: 289 sawcunk, on the mouth of the beaver river, was a lenape settlement and the principal residence of shingas, a chief of theirs. [8] chartier's town was a shawnee town established in 1734 by peter chartier. kittanning was a lenape and shawnee village on the allegheny, with an estimated 300–400 residents.
[9] the first europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. michael bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year european traders established posts and settlements in the area. [10] europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first ohio company, a virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km2) in the upper ohio valley. from a post at present-day cumberland, maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130 km) wagon road to the monongahela river[11] employing a lenape indian chief named nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by capt. michael cresap to begin widening the track into a road.
it mostly followed the same route as an existing native american trail[12] now known as nemacolin's trail. the river crossing and flats at redstone creek, was the earliest point and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road. later in the war, the site fortified as fort burd (now brownsville) was one of several possible destinations. another alternative was the divergent route that became braddock's road a few years later through present-day new stanton. in the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond the cumberland narrows pass before they came into conflict with native americans.
the colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track. the nearby native american community of logstown was an important trade and council center in the ohio valley. [6] between june 15 and november 10, 1749, an expedition headed by celeron de bienville, a french officer, traveled down the allegheny and ohio to bolster the french claim to the region. [12] de bienville warned away british traders and posted markers claiming the territory. [13] in 1753, marquis duquesne, the governor of new france, sent another, larger expedition.
at present-day erie, pennsylvania, an advance party built fort presque isle. they also cut a road through the woods and built fort le boeuf on french creek, from which it was possible at high water to float to the allegheny. by summer, an expedition of 1,500 french and native american men descended the allegheny. some wintered at the confluence of french creek and the allegheny. the following year, they built fort machault at that site.
[14] alarmed at these french incursions in the ohio valley, governor dinwiddie of virginia sent major george washington to warn the french to withdraw. [15] accompanied by christopher gist, washington arrived at the forks of the ohio on november 25, 1753. as i got down before the canoe, i spent some time in viewing the rivers, & the land in the fork, which i think extremely well situated for a fort; as it has the absolute command of both rivers. the land at the point is 20 or 25 feet (7.6 m) above the common surface of the water; & a considerable bottom of flat well timber'd land all around it, very convenient for building. proceeding up the allegheny, washington presented dinwiddie's letter to the french commanders first at venango, and then fort le boeuf. the french officers received washington with wine and courtesy, but did not withdraw.
[15] governor dinwiddie sent captain william trent to build a fort at the forks of the ohio. on february 17, 1754, trent began construction of the fort, the first european habitation[17] at the site of present-day pittsburgh. the fort, named fort prince george, was only half-built by april 1754, when over 500 french forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to virginia. the french tore down the british fortification and constructed fort duquesne. [14][15] governor dinwiddie launched another expedition.
colonel joshua fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command, george washington, leading an advance column. on may 28, 1754, washington's unit clashed with the french in the battle of jumonville glen, during which 13 french soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner. [18] after the battle, washington's ally, seneca chief tanaghrisson, unexpectedly executed the french commanding officer, ensign joseph coulon de jumonville. the french pursued washington and on july 3, 1754, george washington surrendered following the battle of fort necessity. these frontier actions contributed to the start of the french and indian war (1754–1763), or, the seven years' war, a global confrontation between britain and france fought in both hemispheres.
[15][19] in 1755, the braddock expedition was launched, accompanied by virginia militia officer george washington. two regiments marched from fort cumberland across the allegheny mountains and into western pennsylvania. following a path washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road 12 feet (3.7 m) wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross the appalachian mountains. braddock's road, as it was known, blazed the way for the future national road (us40). the expedition crossed the monongahela river on july 9, 1755. french troops from fort duquesne ambushed braddock's expedition at braddock's field, nine miles (14 km) from fort duquesne.
[20] in the battle of the monongahela, the french inflicted heavy losses on the british, and braddock was mortally wounded. [21] the surviving british and colonial forces retreated. this left the french and their native american allies with dominion over the upper ohio valley. [15] on september 8, 1756, an expedition of 300 militiamen destroyed the shawnee and lenape village of kittanning, and in the summer of 1758, british army officer john forbes began a campaign to capture fort duquesne. [21] at the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, forbes built fort ligonier and fort bedford, from where he cut a wagon road over the allegheny mountains, later known as forbes' road.
on the night of september 13–14, 1758, an advance column under major james grant was annihilated in the battle of fort duquesne. [21] the battleground, the high hill east of the point, was named grant's hill in his memory. with this defeat, forbes decided to wait until spring. but when he heard that the french had lost fort frontenac and largely evacuated fort duquesne, he planned an immediate attack. hopelessly outnumbered, the french abandoned and razed fort duquesne.
forbes occupied the burned fort on november 25, 1758, and ordered the construction of fort pitt, named after british secretary of state william pitt the elder. he also named the settlement between the rivers, "pittsborough" (see etymology of pittsburgh). [11][15] the british garrison at fort pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification. [11] the french never attacked fort pitt and the war soon ended with the treaty of paris and french defeat. [15] they ceded their territories east of the mississippi river.
in 1760, the first considerable european settlement around fort pitt began to grow. traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the "lower town," near the fort's ramparts, and the "upper town," along the monongahela as far as present-day market street. in april 1761, a census ordered by colonel henry bouquet and conducted by william clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses. [21][22]: 148 after britain's victory in the french and indian war, increasing dissatisfaction among native americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be indian-occupied (both in the 1758 treaty of easton and in the royal proclamation of 1763 the british authorities had decreed that there would be no british-american settlements west of the alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of pontiac's war. the odawa leader pontiac launched an offensive against british forts in may 1763. native american tribes from the ohio valley and the great lakes overran numerous british forts; one of their most important targets was fort pitt.
receiving warning of the coming attack, captain simeon ecuyer, the swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. he leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts. [11] captain ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. pontiac's forces attacked the fort on june 22, 1763, and the siege of fort pitt lasted for two months. [15] pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from july 27 through august 1, 1763.
[21] they drew off to confront the relieving party under colonel bouquet, which defeated them in the battle of bushy run. [21] this victory ensured british dominion over the forks of the ohio, if not the entire ohio valley. in 1764 colonel bouquet added a redoubt, the fort pitt blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from fort pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the allegheny mountains. [15] the iroquois signed the fort stanwix treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the ohio to the british crown. [21] european expansion into the upper ohio valley increased.
an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. of these settlers, about a third were english-american, another third were scotch-irish, and the rest were welsh, german and others. [23] these groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. the life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. in addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles. [23] settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves.
because of the fear of raids by native americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. they also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts. [4] increasing violence, especially by the shawnee, miami, and wyandot tribes, led to dunmore's war in 1774. conflict with native americans continued throughout the revolutionary war, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. in 1777, fort pitt became a united states fort, when brigadier general edward hand took command. in 1779, colonel daniel brodhead led 600 men from fort pitt to destroy seneca villages along the upper allegheny.
[4] with the war still ongoing, in 1780 virginia and pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of pittsburgh region was pennsylvanian. in 1783, the revolutionary war ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. in the 1784 treaty of fort stanwix, the iroquois ceded the land north of the purchase line to pennsylvania. [4] after the revolution, the village of pittsburgh continued to grow. one of its earliest industries was boat building.
flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver. [24] the village began to develop vital institutions. hugh henry brackenridge, a pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the pittsburgh academy on february 28, 1787. the academy later developed as the university of western pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the university of pittsburgh. [25] many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. at that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier.
when the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, western pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the whiskey rebellion in 1794. farmers from the region rallied at braddock's field and marched on pittsburgh. the short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when president george washington sent in militias from several states. [20] the town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. in 1792, the boatyards in pittsburgh built a sloop, western experiment. [26] during the next decades, the yards produced other large boats.
by the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as europe. in 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on market square. [11] in 1797, the manufacture of glass began. [27] commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods.
blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. by 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops. [11] the 1810s were a critical decade in pittsburgh's growth. in 1811, the first steamboat was built in pittsburgh. increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver.
the war of 1812 catalyzed growth of the iron city. the war with britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of british goods, stimulating american manufacture. [11] in addition, the british blockade of the american coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through pittsburgh from all four directions. by 1815, pittsburgh was producing $764k in iron; $249k in brass and tin, and $235k in glass products. [11] when, on march 18, 1816, pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.
[32] other emerging towns challenged pittsburgh. in 1818, the first segment of the national road was completed, from baltimore to wheeling, bypassing pittsburgh. this threatened to render the town less essential in east–west commerce. in the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. in 1818, the region's first river bridge, the smithfield street bridge, opened, the first step in developing the "city of bridges" over its two rivers.
[citation needed] on october 1, 1840, the original pennsylvania turnpike was completed, connecting pittsburgh and the eastern port city of philadelphia. in 1834, the pennsylvania main line canal was completed, making pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers, roads, and canals. [27] manufacture continued to grow. in 1835, mcclurg, wade and co. built the first locomotive west of the alleghenies. already, pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age.
by the 1840s, pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. in 1841, the second court house, on grant's hill, was completed. made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 80 feet (24 m) high. [33] like many burgeoning cities of its day, pittsburgh's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure. [34] because of this, on april 10, 1845, a great fire burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9m in damages.
[31] as the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. in 1851, the ohio and pennsylvania railroad began service between cleveland and allegheny city (present-day north side). [27] in 1854, the pennsylvania railroad began service between pittsburgh and philadelphia. despite many challenges, pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. an 1857 article provided a snapshot of the iron city:[31] the iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial america by the 1860s.
ingham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. he concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was "largely scotch irish". ingham finds that the scotch irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and "developed their own sense of uniqueness. "[36] new immigrants after 1800 made pittsburgh a major scotch-irish stronghold. for example, thomas mellon (b. ulster 1813–1908) left northern ireland in 1823 for the united states.
he founded the powerful mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. as barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as james laughlin (b. ulster 1806–1882) of jones and laughlin steel company comprised the "scots-irish presbyterian ruling stratum of pittsburgh society. "[37] in 1859, the clinton and soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. the american civil war boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the allegheny arsenal and the fort pitt foundry. [33] arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21" gun.
[38] by war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all u.s. glass was produced in pittsburgh. a milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the edgar thomson works in braddock began to make steel rail using the new bessemer process. [39] industrialists such as andrew carnegie, henry clay frick, andrew w. mellon, and charles m. schwab built their fortunes in pittsburgh. also based in pittsburgh was george westinghouse, credited with such advancements as the air brake and founder of over 60 companies, including westinghouse air and brake company (1869), union switch & signal (1881), and westinghouse electric company (1886). [40] banks played a key role in pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances.
for example, t. mellon & sons bank, founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became alcoa. [39] ingham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. these smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. they embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms.
they also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts. [41] beginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across allegheny county. the new industrial pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. they purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers.
other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. the region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. the rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. as capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries.
transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. by 1910 the pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns. [42] representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of vandergrift, according to mosher (1995). caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, pittsburgh steelmaker george mcmurtry hired frederick law olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design vandergrift as a model town. mcmurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers.
a strike and lockout at mcmurtry's steelworks in apollo, pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. the olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. the rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among mcmurtry's skilled workers and led to mcmurtry's greatest success. in 1901 he used vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the united states steel corporation.
[43] christopher magee and william flinn operated powerful republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. they were business owners and favored business interests. flinn was a leader of the progressive movement statewide and supported theodore roosevelt in the 1912 election. [44] during the mid-19th century, pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of german immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, henry j. heinz, founded the h.j. heinz company in 1869. heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,[45] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union. [46] as a manufacturing center, pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife.
during the great railroad strike of 1877, pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, known as the pittsburgh railway riots. [47] militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike. forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the union depot of the pennsylvania railroad. strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. it was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.
in 1892, a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths (3 detectives, 7 workers) when carnegie steel company's manager henry clay frick sent in pinkertons to break the homestead strike. labor strife continued into the years of the great depression, as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions. unions organized h.j. heinz workers, with the assistance of the catholic radical alliance. andrew carnegie, an immigrant from scotland and a former pennsylvania railroad executive turned steel magnate, founded the carnegie steel company.
he proceeded to play a key role in the development of the u.s. steel industry. he became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first carnegie library, in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. in 1895, he founded the carnegie institute. in 1901, as the u.s. steel corporation formed, he sold his mills to j.p. morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced.
[48] he devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. in pittsburgh, he founded the carnegie institute of technology (now carnegie mellon university) and the carnegie museums of pittsburgh. [39] the third (and present) allegheny county courthouse and jail was completed in 1886. in 1890, trolleys began operations. [27] in 1907, pittsburgh annexed allegheny city, which is now known as the north side. [27] by 1911, pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21] during the prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.
[49][50] several factors fed into resistance to prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the whiskey rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption. [50] the pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade. during that time, prohibition administrator john pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries. [50][51] even the term "speakeasy," meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the blind pig in nearby mckeesport, pennsylvania. [50][52] the last distillery in pittsburgh, joseph s. finch's distillery, located at south second and mckean streets, closed in the 1920s.
[53] in 2012, wigle whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of finch's distillery. [53] the pittsburgh post-gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history. [54] during the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. downstream users complained about pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the ohio river. allegheny county cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the progressive era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s.
steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in nine mile run valley. [55] in november 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank. [56] to escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the shadyside and east end neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. fifth avenue was dubbed "millionaire's row" because of the many mansions lining the street. on march 17 and 18, 1936, pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet.
this catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3b (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work. [57] oakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. oakland's university of pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story cathedral of learning. [58] it towered over forbes field, where the pittsburgh pirates played from 1909 to 1970. [39] between 1870 and 1920, the population of pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of european immigrants arriving to the city.
new arrivals continue to come from britain, ireland, and germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern europe, including italy, the balkans, the austro-hungarian empire, and the russian empire. unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. they introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as south side, polish hill, bloomfield, and squirrel hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 jewish households. [59] the strip district, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of pittsburghers.
[39] the years 1916–1940 marked the largest migration of african americans to pittsburgh during the great migration from the rural south to industrial cities of the northeast and midwest. these migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the south. migrants going to pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities. the black population in pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910. many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in homestead, rankin, braddock, and others nearly doubled.
they succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities. [60][61] historian joe trotter explains the decision process: the newly established black communities nearly all endured, apart from johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. joe trotter explains how the blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the pittsburgh area: the cultural nucleus of black pittsburgh was wylie avenue in the hill district. it became an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as duke ellington and pittsburgh natives billy strayhorn and earl hines played there. two of the negro league's greatest baseball rivals, the pittsburgh crawfords and the homestead grays, often competed in the hill district. the teams dominated the negro national league in the 1930s and 1940s.
[39] pittsburgh was a republican stronghold starting in the 1880s,[64] and the republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. but the great depression starting in 1929 ruined the gop in the city. the democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to republican patronage jobs and assistance. as the depression worsened, pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the new deal coalition. by 1936, democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the wpa, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the democrats.
[65][66] joseph guffey, statewide leader of the democrats, and his local lieutenant david lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in pittsburgh after roosevelt's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a democratic mayor in 1933. guffey and lawrence used the new deal programs to increase their political power and build up a democratic machine that superseded the decaying republican machine. guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only "a challenge" but also "an opportunity." he regarded each relief job as democratic patronage. [67] pittsburgh was at the center of the "arsenal of democracy" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the u.s. during world war ii. pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort.
the increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in african americans moving en masse during the second great migration from the south to the city in order to find work. [11] david lawrence, a democrat, served as mayor of pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963. [68] lawrence used his political power to transform pittsburgh's political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly. [69] in 1946 lawrence decided to enforce the smoke control ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. however, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels.
one round of protests came from italian-american organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, italian americans strongly supported the reelection of lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll. [70] rich and productive, pittsburgh was also the "smoky city," with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers. civic leaders, notably mayor david l. lawrence, elected in 1945, richard k. mellon, chairman of mellon bank and john p. robin[71][72] began smoke control and urban revitalization, also known as urban renewal projects that transformed the city[11] in unforeseen ways.
"renaissance i" began in 1946. title one of the housing act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin. by 1950, vast swaths of buildings and land near the point were demolished for gateway center. 1953 saw the opening of the (since demolished) greater pittsburgh municipal airport terminal. [27] in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the lower hill district, an area inhabited predominantly by poor blacks, was completely destroyed. ninety-five acres of the lower hill district were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), to make room for a cultural center that included the civic arena, which opened in 1961.
[73] other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built. in the early 1960s, the neighborhood of east liberty was also included in renaissance i urban renewal plans, with over 125 acres (0.51 km2) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments, three 20-story public housing apartments, and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district. in the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s, east liberty became a blighted neighborhood. there were some 575 businesses in east liberty in 1959, but only 292 in 1970, and just 98 in 1979. preservation efforts by the pittsburgh history and landmarks foundation, along with community neighborhood groups, resisted the demolition plans. the neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage, including the mexican war streets, allegheny west, and manchester, were spared.
the center of allegheny city, with its culturally and socially important buildings, was not as lucky. all of the buildings, with the exception of the old u.s. post office, the carnegie library, and buhl planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the "pedestrianized" allegheny center mall and apartments. the city's industrial base continued to grow in the post-war era[74] partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the ridc. [75][76] jones and laughlin steel company expanded its plant on the southside. h.j.
heinz, pittsburgh plate glass, alcoa, westinghouse, u.s. steel and its new division, the pittsburgh chemical company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s. [11] 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of renaissance i: the u.s. steel tower and three rivers stadium. [27] in 1974, with the addition of the fountain at the tip of the golden triangle, point state park was completed. [77] although air quality was dramatically improved, and pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects urban renewal continues to have on the social fabric of pittsburgh. pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.
like most major cities, pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following the assassination of martin luther king jr. in april 1968. there were no further major riots, although tension remained high in the inner-city black neighborhoods. [78] during the 1970s and 1980s, the u.s. steel industry came under increasing pressure from foreign competition and from american mini-mills constructed inexpensively using salvaged steel. [citation needed] manufacture in germany and japan was booming. foreign mills and factories, built with the latest technology, benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships, allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products. separately, demand for steel softened due to recessions, the 1973 oil crisis, and increasing use of other materials.
[11][79] the era began with the ridc's "building on basics" report in 1974. [80] free market pressures exposed the u.s. steel industry's own internal problems, which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility of united steelworkers regarding wage cuts and work-rule reforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management. in particular, pittsburgh faced its own challenges. local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted, raising material costs. the large mills in the pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer, more profitable "mini-mills" and non-union mills with lower labor costs.
[79] beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the steel industry in pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the u.s.[81] following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. [79] the steel mills began to shut down. these closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. [82][83] the local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. [84] pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the rust belt with a declining population, and like many other u.s. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.
[85] in 1991 the homestead works was demolished, replaced in 1999 by the waterfront shopping mall. as a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in homestead dwindled. by the time of the 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. the borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base. top corporate headquarters such as gulf oil (1985), koppers (1987), westinghouse (1996) and rockwell international (1989) were bought out by larger firms, with the loss of high paying, white collar headquarters and research personnel (the "brain drain") as well as massive charitable contributions by the "home based" companies to local cultural and educational institutions. at the time of the gulf oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was no.
7 on the fortune 500 just six years earlier. over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and phd research jobs were lost in one day. today, there are no steel mills within the city limits of pittsburgh, although manufacture continues at regional mills, such as the edgar thomson works in nearby braddock. pittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under-graduate and graduate school national rankings, the university of pittsburgh, carnegie mellon university and duquesne university. carnegie mellon university and the university of pittsburgh had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development.
the collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields. [86] other regional collegiate institutions include robert morris university, chatham university, carlow university, point park university, la roche college, pittsburgh theological seminary, trinity school for ministry (an episcopal seminary) and the community college of allegheny county. beginning in the 1980s, pittsburgh's economy shifted from heavy industry to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. today, the top two private employers in the city are the university of pittsburgh medical center (26,000 employees) and the west penn allegheny health system (13,000 employees). [87][88] despite the economic turmoil, civic improvements continued.
in the mid-1970s, arthur p. ziegler, jr. and the pittsburgh history and landmarks foundation (landmarks) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies. landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the pittsburgh and lake erie railroad, a 1-mile (1.6 km) long property at the base of mt. washington facing the city of pittsburgh. in 1976, landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historic adaptive reuse development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice. aided by an initial generous gift from the allegheny foundation in 1976, landmarks adapted five historic pittsburgh and lake erie railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the gateway clipper fleet, and parking areas.
now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the monongahela river, opposite the golden triangle (pittsburgh). station square is pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. it reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the pittsburgh region since the 1950s. in 1994, pittsburgh history and landmarks foundation sold station square in to forest city enterprises which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. each year the staff and docents of pittsburgh history and landmarks foundation introduce more than 10,000 people – teachers, students, adults, and visitors – to the architectural heritage of the pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.
[89] during this period, pittsburgh also became a national model for community development, through the work of activists such as dorothy mae richardson, who founded neighborhood housing services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide neighborworks america. activists such a richardson shared the aim of landmarks to rehabilitate pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop. in 1985, the j & l steel site on the north side of the monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized high technology center was built. the pittsburgh technology center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon. [27] in the 1980s, the "renaissance ii" urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such as ppg place.
in the 1990s, the former sites of the homestead, duquesne and south side j&l mills were cleared. [27] in 1992, the new terminal at pittsburgh international airport opened. [27] in 2001, the aging three rivers stadium was replaced by heinz field and pnc park, despite being rejected by voter referendum. in 2010, ppg paints arena, replaced the civic arena, which at the time was the oldest arena in the national hockey league. [90] also in 1985, al michaels revealed to a national tv audience how pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city.
[91] present-day pittsburgh, with a diversified economy, a low cost of living, and a rich infrastructure for medicine and education and culture, has been ranked as one of the world's most livable cities. [92] tourism has recently boomed in pittsburgh with nearly 3,000 new hotel rooms opening since 2004 and holding a consistently higher occupancy than in comparable cities. medicine has replaced steel as a leading industry. [93] meanwhile, tech giants such as apple, google, ibm watson, facebook, and intel have joined the 1,600 technology firms choosing to operate out of pittsburgh. as a result of the proximity to cmu's national robotics engineering center (nrec), there has a boom of autonomous vehicles companies.
the region has also become a leader in green environmental design, a movement exemplified by the city's convention center. in the last twenty years the region has seen a small but influential group of asian immigrants, including from the indian sub-continent. it has been generally considered as the most recovered city from the rust belt. [94] content from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_page: takin' it back is the fifth major-label studio album by american singer-songwriter meghan trainor. epic records released it on october 21, 2022. trainor worked with producers including federico vindver and gian stone and featured artists like teddy swims and natti natasha.
inspired by the sound of her album title (2015) after its title track went viral on tiktok, takin' it back is a doo-wop and bubblegum-pop album about motherhood and self-acceptance. trainor promoted the latter with televised performances and two singles, "bad for me" and "made you look". the latter peaked at number 11 in the us and reached the top 10 in several other countries. reviewers thought takin' it back showcased trainor's maturity, growth, and musicality, but they were divided on whether it was a progression from her earlier work. the album debuted at number 16 on the us billboard 200. its deluxe edition was supported by the single "mother".
(this article is part of two featured topics: takin' it back and meghan trainor albums.) october 21 the 2017 american animated fantasy comedy-drama film coco won 63 awards from 81 nominations. produced by pixar animation studios and released by walt disney pictures, the film got particular recognition for its score, composed by michael giacchino (pictured). at the 90th academy awards, coco won best animated feature and best original song. the film garnered two nominations at the 75th golden globe awards, winning for best animated feature film.
coco also won the bafta award for best animated film and the critics' choice movie award for both best animated feature and best song. it was named one of the ten best films of 2017 by the national board of review. (full list...) x-rays are a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, with wavelengths shorter than those of ultraviolet rays and longer than those of gamma rays – roughly in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometres. x-rays were discovered by german scientist wilhelm röntgen in 1895, who named them x-radiation to signify an unknown type of radiation. x-rays can penetrate many solid substances such as construction materials and living tissue, and x-ray radiography is widely used in medical diagnostics.
this medical significance was noticed by röntgen shortly after he discovered x-rays; this print, titled hand mit ringen (hand with rings), is a print of his first medical x-ray, taken of his wife anna bertha ludwig's hand in december 1895. print credit: wilhelm röntgen; restored by yann forget wikipedia is written by volunteer editors and hosted by the wikimedia foundation, a non-profit organization that also hosts a range of other volunteer projects: this wikipedia is written in english. many other wikipedias are available; some of the largest are listed below. content from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:contents: explore the vast knowledge of wikipedia through these helpful resources. if you have a specific topic in mind, use wikipedia's search box. if you don't know exactly what you are looking for or wish to explore broad areas, click on a link in the header menu at the top of this page, or begin your browsing below: wikipedia organizes its content into distinct subject classifications, each with further subdivisions.

in 1912, it became the carnegie institute of technology and began granting four-year degrees. in 1967, it became carnegie mellon university through its merger with the mellon institute of industrial research, founded in 1913 by andrew mellon and richard b. mellon and formerly a part of the university of pittsburgh. [11] the university consists of seven colleges, including the college of engineering, the school of computer science, and the tepper school of business. [12] the university has its main campus located 5 miles (8 km) from downtown pittsburgh. it also has over a dozen degree-granting locations in six continents, including campuses in qatar, silicon valley, and kigali, rwanda (carnegie mellon university africa) and partnerships with universities nationally and globally.
[13] carnegie mellon enrolls 15,818 students across its multiple campuses from 117 countries and employs more than 1,400 faculty members. [14] carnegie mellon is known for its advances in research and new fields of study, home to many firsts in computer science (including the first machine learning, robotics, and computational biology departments), pioneering the field of management science,[15] and the first drama program in the united states. carnegie mellon is a member of the association of american universities and is classified among "r1: doctoral universities – very high research activity". [16] carnegie mellon competes in ncaa division iii athletics as a founding member of the university athletic association. carnegie mellon fields eight men's teams and nine women's teams as the tartans.
[17] the university's faculty and alumni include 21 nobel prize laureates and 13 turing award winners and have received 142 emmy awards, 64 tony awards, and 13 academy awards. [18] the carnegie technical schools were founded in 1900 in pittsburgh, pennsylvania[19] by the scottish-american industrialist and philanthropist andrew carnegie, who wrote "my heart is in the work", when he donated the funds to create the institution. carnegie's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class pittsburghers, many of whom worked in his mills. carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the pratt institute in brooklyn, new york, founded by industrialist charles pratt in 1887. [20] in 1912, the institution changed its name to carnegie institute of technology (cit) and began offering four-year degrees.
during this time, cit consisted of four constituent schools: the school of fine and applied arts, the school of apprentices and journeymen, the school of science and technology, and the margaret morrison carnegie school for women. the mellon institute of industrial research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers andrew mellon (who went on to become u.s. treasury secretary) and richard b. mellon in honor of their father, thomas mellon, patriarch of the mellon family. the institute began as a research organization that performed contract work for government and industry, initially as a department within the university of pittsburgh. in 1927, the mellon institute was incorporated as an independent nonprofit. in 1937, the mellon institute's iconic building was completed on fifth avenue.
[21] in 1967, with support from paul mellon, the carnegie institute of technology merged with the mellon institute of industrial research to become carnegie mellon university. in 1973, carnegie mellon's coordinate women's college, the margaret morrison carnegie college, merged its academic programs with the rest of the university. [22] the industrial research mission of the mellon institute survived the merger as the carnegie mellon research institute (cmri) and continued doing work on contract to industry and government. in 2001, cmri's programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into autonomous entities. [23] carnegie mellon's 157.2 acre (63 ha) main campus is five miles (8 km) from downtown pittsburgh, between schenley park and the neighborhoods of squirrel hill, shadyside, and oakland.
[5] carnegie mellon is bordered to the west by the campus of the university of pittsburgh. carnegie mellon owns 81 buildings in the oakland and squirrel hill neighborhoods of pittsburgh. for decades, the center of student life on campus was skibo hall, the university's student union. built in the 1950s, skibo hall's design was typical of mid-century modern architecture but was poorly equipped to deal with advances in computer and internet connectivity. the original skibo hall was razed in the summer of 1994 and replaced by a new student union that is fully wi-fi enabled.
known as the university center, the building was dedicated in 1996. in 2014, carnegie mellon re-dedicated the university center as the cohon university center in recognition of the eighth president of the university, jared cohon. [24] a large grassy area known as "the cut" forms the backbone of the campus, with a separate grassy area known as "the mall" running perpendicular. the cut was formed by filling in a ravine (hence the name) with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the college of fine arts building. the northwestern part of the campus (home to hamburg hall, newell-simon hall, smith hall, and gates hillman complex) was acquired from the united states bureau of mines in the 1980s. carnegie mellon has been purchasing 100% renewable energy for its electricity since 2011.
[25] the campus began to take shape in the beaux-arts architecture style of george carnegie palmer and henry hornbostel of palmer & hornbostel, winners of the 1904 competition to design the original institution and later the founder of the carnegie mellon school of architecture. [26] there was little change to the campus between the first and second world war. a 1938 master plan by githens and keally suggested acquisition of new land along forbes avenue, but the plan was not fully implemented. the period starting with the construction of the hall of the arts building (former home of the graduate school of industrial administration) in 1952 and ending with wean hall in 1971 saw the institutional change from carnegie institute of technology to carnegie mellon university. new facilities were needed to respond to the university's growing national reputation in artificial intelligence, business, robotics and the arts.
in addition, an expanding student population demanded improved facilities for student life, athletics and libraries. the campus finally expanded to forbes avenue from its original land along schenley park. the buildings of this era reflected contemporary architectural styles. the international style, with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, had been in vogue in european settings since the 1930s. it came late to the carnegie mellon campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among american universities to abandon historical styles.
by the 1960s, the international style was adopted to accomplish needed expansion quickly and affordably with the swelling of student ranks in the aftermath of the gi bill in 1944. each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement, but not in its form or materials. during the 1970s and 1980s, the tenure of president richard cyert (1972–1990) witnessed a period of growth and development. the research budget grew from roughly $12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than $110 million in the late 1980s. researchers in new fields like robotics and software engineering helped the university to build its reputation. one example was the introduction of the "andrew" computing network in the mid-1980s.
this project linking all computers and workstations on campus set the standard for educational computing and established carnegie mellon as a technology leader in education and research. on april 24, 1985, cmu.edu, carnegie mellon's internet domain, became one of the first six .edu domain names. in the 1990s and into the 2000s, carnegie mellon solidified its status among american universities, consistently ranking in the top 25 in the national u.s. news & world report rankings, and in the top 30 (ranking 28th in 2022) amongst universities worldwide. [28][29] carnegie mellon is distinct in its interdisciplinary approach to research and education. through the establishment of programs and centers outside the limitations of departments or colleges, the university has established leadership in fields such as computational finance, information systems, cognitive sciences, management, arts management, product design, behavioral economics, energy science and economics, human–computer interaction, entertainment technology, and decision science.
within the past two decades, the university has built a new university center (cohon university center), theater and drama building (purnell center for the arts), business school building (tepper school of business), and several dormitories. baker hall was renovated in the early 2000s, and new chemistry labs were established in doherty hall soon after. several computer science buildings, such as newell-simon hall, also were established, renovated or renamed in the early 2000s. in 2006, carnegie mellon trustee jill gansman kraus donated the 80-foot (24 m)-tall sculpture walking to the sky, which was placed on the lawn facing forbes avenue between the cohon university center and warner hall. the sculpture was controversial for its placement, the general lack of input from the campus community, and its (lack of) aesthetic appeal.
[30] the gates hillman complex opened for occupancy on august 7, 2009. [31] it sits on a 5.6-acre (2.3 ha) site on the university's west campus, surrounded by cyert hall, the purnell center for the arts, doherty hall, newell-simon hall, smith hall, hamburg hall, and the robert mehrabian collaborative innovation center. it contains 318 offices as well as labs, computer clusters, lecture halls, classrooms and a 255-seat auditorium. the gates hillman complex was made possible by a $20 million lead gift from the bill & melinda gates foundation and an additional $10 million grant from the henry l. hillman foundation. the gates hillman complex and the purnell center for the arts are connected by the randy pausch memorial footbridge.
[32] on april 15, 1997, jared l. cohon, former dean of the yale school of forestry & environmental studies, was elected president by carnegie mellon's board of trustees. during cohon's presidency, carnegie mellon continued its trajectory of innovation and growth. his strategic plan aimed to leverage the university's strengths to benefit society in the areas of biotechnology and life sciences, information and security technology, environmental science and practices, the fine arts and humanities, and business and public policy. in 2006, following negotiations between president cohon and south australian premier mike rann, cmu opened a campus of the heinz college in the historic torrens building in adelaide, australia. president cohon's term ended on june 30, 2013, after which he returned to the faculty at carnegie mellon.
on july 1, 2003, carnegie mellon launched "insp!re innovation", a $1 billion comprehensive fundraising campaign. half of the campaign goal is intended for the endowment to provide long-lasting support for faculty, students and breakthrough innovations. the campaign brought in a total of $1.19 billion, with $578.5 million going toward carnegie mellon's endowment. it also enabled the university to establish 31 endowed professorships, 97 endowed fellowships and 250 endowed scholarships. [33] on september 7, 2011, william s. dietrich ii, the former chairman of dietrich industries, inc., a subsidiary of worthington industries, inc., pledged a gift of $265 million, effective on october 6, 2011, upon his death.
in response to this gift, carnegie mellon renamed the college of humanities and social sciences as the marianna brown dietrich college of humanities and social sciences after william dietrich's mother. [34] on april 23, 2012, new york's mayor michael r. bloomberg and new york university's president john sexton announced an agreement between new york city, new york's mta, and a consortium of academic institutions, and private technology companies that led to the creation in new york of a center for urban science and progress (cusp). the center for urban science and progress (cusp) is an applied science research institute composed of a partnership of institutions from around the globe, led by new york university with a consortium of universities including carnegie mellon, the university of warwick, the city university of new york, the indian institute of technology bombay, and the university of toronto. in september 2012, carnegie mellon announced the construction of the sherman and joyce bowie scott hall on the pittsburgh campus. the new building is situated between hamerschlag hall, roberts hall, and wean hall and houses the university-wide wilton e. scott institute for energy innovation, the bertucci nanotechnology lab, the engineering research accelerator (formerly known as the institute for complex engineered systems), the disruptive health technologies institute, and the department of biomedical engineering.
[35] further, in november 2013, carnegie mellon announced a $67 million gift from david tepper, who previously donated $56 million, to develop the tepper quadrangle on the north campus. the tepper quad includes a new tepper school of business facility across forbes avenue from a renovated and expanded hamburg hall (home to heinz college)[36] as well as other university-wide buildings and a welcome center which serves as a public gateway to the university. [37] in april 2015, carnegie mellon, in collaboration with jones lang lasalle, announced the planning of a second office space structure, alongside the robert mehrabian collaborative innovation center, an upscale and full-service hotel, and retail and dining development along forbes avenue. this complex will connect to the tepper quadrangle, the heinz college, the tata consultancy services building, and the gates-hillman center to create an innovation corridor on the university campus. the effort is intended to continue to attract major corporate partnerships to create opportunities for research, teaching, and employment with students and faculty.
[38] on october 30, 2019, carnegie mellon publicly announced the launch of "make possible: the campaign for carnegie mellon university", a campaign which seeks to raise $2 billion to advance the university's priorities, including campus development. [39] alongside the tepper quad and hamburg hall, carnegie mellon finished construction in 2020 on tcs hall, an innovation center made possible with a $35 million gift from tata consultancy services. [40] carnegie mellon plans to collaborate with emerald cloud lab to construct the world's first cloud lab in a university setting. the carnegie mellon university cloud lab is planned to be completed by the spring of 2023. carnegie mellon also plans to construct a new mechanical engineering building by fall 2023 (scaife hall), a new $105 million athletics center by fall 2024 (highmark center for health, wellness and athletics), a $210 million science futures building (r.k. mellon hall of sciences) by 2026,[41] as well as a robotics innovation center at hazelwood green, in addition to new dormitories and other buildings in the coming years. [42] on february 5, 2013, carnegie mellon announced the selection of subra suresh, director of the national science foundation and dean of the massachusetts institute of technology school of engineering, as its ninth president effective july 1, 2013.
[43] suresh stepped down in june 2017[44] and was replaced by farnam jahanian, the university's interim-president and former provost, in march 2018. [45] on september 8, 2022, carnegie mellon announced a $275.7 million partnership with the mastercard foundation to support carnegie mellon university africa in kigali, rwanda. carnegie mellon's kigali campus provides graduate-level study in engineering and artificial intelligence. on november 6, 2023, carnegie mellon trustee ray lane and his wife stephanie lane invested $25 million in support of the university's computational biology department. [46] on april 12, 2024, carnegie mellon broke ground for construction of its new richard king mellon hall of sciences, a 338,900 square-foot addition to its campus.
[47] nationally, u.s. news & world report placed carnegie mellon in a tie with washington university in st. louis and the university of michigan for 21st place among american research universities in their 2024-2025 rankings. [56] many of its graduate programs have been ranked in national and international surveys. in 2022, u.s. news ranked carnegie mellon as having 23 graduate programs in the top 10 nationwide and 16 in the top 5 nationwide.,[57] including three programs ranked first: artificial intelligence, programming languages, and information and technology management. in particular, the cmu school of computer science has been consistently ranked the best in the nation, tied with mit, stanford, and uc berkeley. [58] globally, carnegie mellon is ranked 28th by times higher education and 52nd by qs world university rankings.
carnegie mellon was named one of the "new ivies" by newsweek. [59] in 2010, the wall street journal ranked carnegie mellon 1st in computer science, 4th in finance, 10th overall, and 21st in engineering according to job recruiters. [60] carnegie mellon ranks thirteenth among "best colleges by salary potential (bachelor's only)" in the united states according to payscale's 2016–17 study. [61] in 2024, carnegie mellon's tepper school of business placed 9th in an annual ranking of u.s. business schools by bloomberg businessweek. [62] in 2016, the hollywood reporter ranked the school of drama 3rd in the world among undergraduate drama schools.

[81] the university is need-blind for domestic applicants. [82] the class of 2026 enrolled students from 46 u.s. states and 42 countries. [79] undergraduate tuition for 2023-2024 is $62,260, and room and board is $17,468. [83] cmu is classified among "r1: doctoral universities – very high research activity". [16] for the 2021 fiscal year, the university spent $402 million on research.
the primary recipients of this funding were the school of computer science ($100.3 million), the software engineering institute ($71.7 million), the college of engineering ($48.5 million), and the mellon college of science ($47.7 million). the research money comes largely from federal sources, with a federal investment of $234.9 million in 2021. the federal agencies that invest the most money include the national science foundation and the department of defense, which contributed $70.5 million and $90.4 million in 2021, respectively. [84] the recognition of carnegie mellon as one of the best research facilities in the nation has a long history. as early as the 1987 federal budget, cmu was ranked as third in the amount of federal research funds received with $41.5 million, with only mit and johns hopkins receiving more research funds from the department of defense. [85] the pittsburgh supercomputing center (psc) is a joint effort between carnegie mellon, university of pittsburgh, and westinghouse electric company.
psc was founded in 1986 by its two scientific directors, ralph roskies of the university of pittsburgh and michael levine of carnegie mellon. psc is a leading partner in the teragrid, the national science foundation's cyberinfrastructure program. [86] the neuroscience institute (ni) is a university-wide research institute that was founded in 2018 [87] [88] [89] as a successor to an earlier effort, known as brainhub. [90] [91] combining research in computer science, engineering, machine learning, statistics, and cognitive science with basic neuroscience, ni aims to promote research that will improve the human condition. devices developed by the institute have been designed to enable communication for locked-in patients,[92] treatments for parkinson's disease,[93] improved brain imaging technology using artificial intelligence,[94] and electrodes that work with coarse, curly hair.
[95] ni includes over 30 faculty and 100 trainees from four colleges and oversees two phd programs (the program in neural computation and the program in systems neuroscience) that have received support from the national institutes of health. [96] [97] numerous philanthropic gifts help support ni research. [98] [99] [100] [101] ni also provides direct administrative and monetary support for the center for neural basis of cognition, a long-running collaboration with the university of pittsburgh. [102] [103] the robotics institute (ri) is a division of the school of computer science and considered to be one of the leading centers of robotics research in the world. the field robotics center (frc) has developed a number of significant robots, including sandstorm and h1ghlander, which finished second and third in the darpa grand challenge, and boss, which won the darpa urban challenge.
the robotics institute has partnered with a spinoff company, astrobotic technology inc., to land a cmu robot on the moon by 2016 in pursuit of the google lunar xprize. the robot, known as andy, is designed to explore lunar pits, which might include entrances to caves. [104] the ri is primarily sited at carnegie mellon's main campus in newell-simon hall. [105] the software engineering institute (sei) is a federally funded research and development center sponsored by the u.s. department of defense and operated by carnegie mellon, with offices in pittsburgh, pennsylvania, usa and arlington, virginia. the sei publishes books on software engineering for industry, government and military applications and practices.
the organization is known for its capability maturity model[106][107] (cmm) and capability maturity model integration (cmmi), which identify essential elements of effective system and software engineering processes and can be used to rate the level of an organization's capability for producing quality systems. the sei is also the home of cert/cc, the federally funded computer security organization. the cert program's primary goals are to support secure requirements and development of computer systems and ensure that appropriate technology and systems management practices are used to resist attacks on networked systems and to limit damage and ensure continuity of critical services subsequent to attacks, accidents, or failures. [108] the human–computer interaction institute (hcii) is a division of the school of computer science and is considered one of the leading centers of human–computer interaction research, integrating computer science, design, social science, and learning science. [109] such interdisciplinary collaboration is the hallmark of research done throughout the university.
the language technologies institute (lti) is another unit of the school of computer science and is famous for being one of the leading research centers in the area of language technologies. the primary research focus of the institute is on machine translation, speech recognition, speech synthesis, information retrieval, parsing and information extraction. [110] until 1996, the institute existed as the center for machine translation that was established in 1986. from 1996 onwards, it started awarding graduate degrees and the name was changed to language technologies institute. the ray and stephanie lane computational biology department, one of the seven departments in the school of computer science, was established in 2007 (as lane center for computational biology), officially became a department within the school of computer science in 2009, and named the ray and stephanie lane computational biology department in 2023. the department is the leader in developing computational methodologies to advance biomedical research. carnegie mellon is also home to the carnegie school of management and economics.
this intellectual school grew out of the tepper school of business in the 1950s and 1960s and focused on the intersection of behavioralistm and management. several management theories, most notably bounded rationality and the behavioral theory of the firm, were established by carnegie school management scientists and economists. carnegie mellon also develops cross-disciplinary and university-wide institutes and initiatives to take advantage of strengths in various colleges and departments and develop solutions in critical social and technical problems. to date, these have included the cylab security and privacy institute, the wilton e. scott institute for energy innovation, the neuroscience institute, the simon initiative, and the disruptive healthcare technology institute. carnegie mellon has made a concerted effort to attract corporate research labs, offices, and partnerships to the pittsburgh campus.
apple inc., intel, google, microsoft, disney, facebook, ibm, general motors, bombardier inc., yahoo!, uber, tata consultancy services, ansys, boeing, robert bosch gmbh, and the rand corporation have established a presence on or near campus. in collaboration with intel, carnegie mellon has pioneered research into claytronics. [111] in addition to its pittsburgh campus, carnegie mellon has a branch campus in the middle east, carnegie mellon university in qatar, which offers a full undergraduate curriculum with degree programs in computer science, business administration, biology, computational biology, and information systems. the campus is located in doha's education city which is home to multiple other u.s. universities all of which are funded by the qatar foundation. the qatari campus has been the subject of controversy, as islamic cultural values and laws in qatar differ greatly from the core values of carnegie mellon.
[112] additionally, carnegie mellon and other u.s. universities in education city have been criticized for being essentially complicit in qatar's corruption, connections with hamas and their questionable human rights record by continuing to operate there. [112][113][114][115] it also has graduate-level extension campuses in mountain view, california in the heart of silicon valley (offering masters programs in software engineering and software management). the tepper school of business maintains a satellite center in downtown manhattan and the heinz college maintains one in adelaide, australia. the heinz college, the institute for politics and strategy, and the department of engineering and public policy host centers in washington, d.c. as part of degree programs, research, and government affairs initiatives as well as being a part of the university of california, washington center. carnegie mellon also established the integrative media program at steiner studios in brooklyn, new york.
carnegie mellon also maintains the carnegie mellon los angeles center in north hollywood, california where students in the master of entertainment industry management program are required to relocate to los angeles in their second year and attend classes at this facility. carnegie mellon's information networking institute offers graduate programs in athens, greece and kobe, japan, in collaboration with athens information technology and the hyogo institute of information education foundation, respectively. in the fall of 2007, the cities of aveiro and lisbon, portugal were added to the information networking institute's remote locations. the software and societal systems department (s3d) offers graduate programs in coimbra, portugal. the entertainment technology center offers graduate programs in portugal, japan, and singapore.
the human–computer interaction institute offers a master's degree in conjunction with the university of madeira, in portugal at the jointly founded madeira interactive technologies institute. the college of engineering has an international location in kigali, rwanda offering the master of science in information technology and the master of science in electrical and computer engineering. the campus of carnegie mellon in pittsburgh has served as the locale for many motion pictures. alumnus george a. romero filmed creepshow (1982) in and around margaret morrison carnegie hall. [116] much of the on-campus scenes in the 2000 film wonder boys, starring michael douglas and tobey maguire, were filmed in carnegie mellon's campus.
[117] other movies filmed at carnegie mellon include the mothman prophecies, dogma, lorenzo's oil, hoffa, the dark knight rises, where'd you go, bernadette, and flashdance. the university is also featured prominently in the films smart people, monkey shines, and in the anime summer wars. the musical pippin was originally conceived by stephen schwartz as a student musical performed by the scotch'n'soda student theatre troupe. [118] schwartz also collaborated with drama student john-michael tebelak to expand his master's thesis project titled godspell, created under the direction of lawrence carra, into a musical. [119] while enrolled at carnegie mellon, acting students michael mckean and david lander (class of 1969) created the characters "lenny and squiggy".
[120] the pair continued performing the characters in live comedy routines before joining the cast of the tv series laverne & shirley. in 2008, carnegie mellon professor randy pausch's "last lecture" became a pop culture phenomenon. based on a lecture he gave in september 2007 – shortly after he learned his cancer had metastasized – his book quickly rose to the top of bestseller lists around the country. named in time magazine's time 100 list of influential people, he died in july 2008 from pancreatic cancer. [121] in 2003, carnegie mellon established the robot hall of fame in partnership with the carnegie science center.
the 68th tony awards in 2014 announced carnegie mellon as its first educational partner in jointly awarding the "tony honor for excellence in theatre education", which will "honor kindergarten through high school (k-12) theatre educators". [122] carnegie mellon also runs the integrative design, arts, and technology (ideate) network to provide university-wide arts and technology education to students from every college. ideate allows students to take minors or concentrations in animation and special effects, entrepreneurship for creative industries, game design, intelligent environments, learning media, media design, physical computing, and sound design. ideate will also offer graduate master's degrees in emerging media, game design, integrative innovation for products and services, computational data science, urban design, and production technology and management. ideate also manages the entertainment technology center (etc) in conjunction with the school of computer science and the college of fine arts.
each master's degree program has an option to study in the cmu integrative media program (imp) at steiner studios in new york city. ideate network will be based on the pittsburgh campus upon the development of recently acquired property on forbes avenue west of junction hollow. [133] in addition to research and academic institutions, the university hosts several other educationally driven programs. the pennsylvania governor's school for the sciences, a state-funded summer program that aims to foster interest in science amongst gifted high school students is run on campus every summer. the university also runs carnegie mellon pre-college, a six-week residential program for rising juniors and seniors in high school and the summer academy for math and science (sams), a free-of-charge stem immersion program for students from underrepresented backgrounds.
the cyert center for early education is a child care center for carnegie mellon faculty and staff, as well as an observational setting for students in child development courses. carnegie mellon also developed the open learning initiative which provides free courses online in a variety of fields to students globally. the libraries of carnegie mellon include hunt library, the roger sorrells engineering & science library, the mellon institute library, the posner center, and the qatar library. additionally, the libraries' million book project (2001–) sparked development of the universal digital library. the university libraries host a number of full text special collections for public access, including the andrew carnegie collection, herbert a. simon collection, allen newell collection, the h. john heinz iii collection, the pittsburgh jewish newspapers project, and the posner memorial collection.
carnegie mellon students and faculty have access to the carnegie library of pittsburgh and some university of pittsburgh libraries through consortial agreements with those institutions. the hunt institute for botanical documentation (hibd),[134] dedicated as the rachel mcmasters miller hunt botanical library in 1961, has been a research division of cmu since its founding. the hibd is an international bibliographical research and service in the fields of botany, horticulture, and the history of the plant sciences and has a significant research library and art holdings on the 5th floor of hunt library. the university's software engineering institute also houses a research library. carnegie mellon also manages the naval reserve officer training corps in pittsburgh on which students throughout pittsburgh's universities rely.
carnegie mellon partners with the university of pittsburgh to provide opportunities in army reserve officers' training corps and air force reserve officer training corps to its students. carnegie mellon is accredited by the middle states commission on higher education. [135] carnegie mellon neighbors the campus of the university of pittsburgh, and in some cases, buildings of the two universities are intermingled. this helps to facilitate myriad academic and research collaborations between the two schools,[136] including such projects as the pittsburgh supercomputing center, the pittsburgh life sciences greenhouse, the immune modeling center, the center for the neural basis of cognition, the university of pittsburgh cancer institute, as well as the national science foundation-supported pittsburgh science of learning center. [137][138] further, the universities also offer multiple dual and joint degree programs such as the medical scientist training program, the molecular biophysics and structural biology graduate program, the joint cmu-pitt ph.d. program in computational biology, the center for neural basis of cognition, and the law and business administration program.
some professors hold joint professorships between the two schools, and students at each university may take classes at the other (with appropriate approvals). [139] cmu students and faculty also have access to the university of pittsburgh library system, as well as the carnegie library of pittsburgh. the two universities also co-host academic conferences, such as the 2012 second language research forum. [140] in 2015, in conjunction with the university of pittsburgh and upmc, carnegie mellon became a partner of the pittsburgh health data alliance to leverage data analysis in health care. [141] the swartz center for entrepreneurship acts as carnegie mellon's startup accelerator.
jim swartz, co-founder of accel partners, pledged $31 million to establish a hub for university wide entrepreneurial activities. his gift is the fifth largest carnegie mellon has received. in 2016, the center opened providing a business incubator and makerspace. [149] the center employs entrepreneurs-in-residence who mentor founders of early stage companies consisting of students, faculty, and alumni. [150] startups work on their ideas throughout the year culminating at an annual demo day where they showcase their company to the public.
[151] carnegie mellon's alumni, faculty, and staff have founded many notable companies, some of which are shown below. [152][153] carnegie mellon's student life includes over 400 student organizations, art galleries, and various unique traditions. student organizations provide social, service, media, academic, spiritual, recreational, sport, religious, political, cultural, and governance opportunities. carnegie mellon's campus houses several galleries such as the frame, a student-devoted gallery, and the regina gouger miller gallery, an art gallery that specializes in contemporary professional artists. the carnegie mellon school of music, carnegie mellon school of drama, and the student-run theatrical organization scotch'n'soda provides campus with a variety of performance arts events.
the university has a strong scottish motif inspired by andrew carnegie's scottish heritage, as well as the mellon family's scots-irish ancestry. examples include scotty, the scottish terrier mascot, the tartan student newspaper, skibo gymnasium, the thistle yearbook, and the céilidh weekend every fall semester for homecoming. [155] in the early days of carnegie tech, there was a single bridge connecting margaret morrison women's college with the carnegie institute of technology. the bridge was a meeting place for students. in 1916, the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area.
the administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place. the students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence. the administration was about to give up and tear it down, but that night a fraternity, as a prank, painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party. ever since, painting the fence has been a carnegie mellon tradition. [156] the fence at carnegie mellon lies at the center of campus, in the area known as "the cut".
students guard the fence 24 hours a day, and, as long as two vigils are maintained, no other student may "take" the fence. the fence can then be painted by the group that has it, but only between midnight and 6 am. only hand brushes may be used; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine. the previous paint cannot be stripped, and each new painting adds a new layer. the original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1' of surrounding paint, and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete.
today the fence is considered "the world's most painted object" by the guinness book of world records. [157] carnegie mellon offers conventional housing for its students through single-gender, coresidential, and special interest options. students can choose from a variety of housing options. the four options for students are traditional, semi-suite, suite, and apartments. the traditional is a typical college dormitory setting, a long hallway with a series of 1-3 person rooms and a community bathroom shared with an entire floor or wing.
semi-suite offers more privacy through 1-4 person rooms with 3-5 residents sharing one semi-private bathroom. suite is similar to semi-suite but contains additional bedrooms, a bathroom, and living room/lounge area shared with 3-8 other residents. apartments are shared between 1-3 people and may contain additional bedrooms, a semi-private bathroom, a living room, and kitchen shared with the other residents. upperclassmen have additional options for housing, which include town houses and a larger variety of one or two bedroom apartments. [158] there are 27 residential buildings on campus and even more off campus.
[159] first-year students are assigned to the dedicated first-year residence halls on campus including morewood e-tower, morewood gardens, residence on fifth, shirley apartments, as well as boss, donner, hamerschlag, mcgill, mudge, scobell, and stever houses. approximately one-third of upperclassmen choose to continue living on campus through university housing. options for upperclassmen include fifth & clyde, morewood gardens, west wing, doherty, fairfax, margaret morrison, fifth neville, shady oak, shirley, forbes & beeler, and woodlawn apartments as well as henderson, resnik, roselawn, spirit, tech, webster, and welch houses. [160] the greek tradition at carnegie mellon began over 100 years ago with the founding of the first fraternity on campus, theta xi, in 1912. the panhellenic sorority community was founded in 1945, by chi omega, delta delta delta, delta gamma, kappa alpha theta, and kappa kappa gamma. the chi omega chapter at carnegie mellon transformed into an independent sorority, zeta psi sigma, and has since become alpha chi omega.
the alpha phi chapter was created in april 2013. there are two asian american interest sororities – alpha kappa delta phi and kappa phi lambda –, and one asian american interest fraternity – lambda phi epsilon. carnegie mellon has eleven active fraternities: alpha epsilon pi, alpha phi alpha, alpha sigma phi, delta tau delta, lambda phi epsilon, phi delta theta, pi kappa alpha, sigma alpha epsilon, sigma chi, sigma nu, and sigma phi epsilon. in addition to participating in campus traditions such as buggy and booth, the fraternities and sororities hold an annual fundraiser called greek sing, one of the largest greek events of the year. every two years, the organizations vote on a cause to support and raise money through ticket sales, ad sales, corporate sponsorships and donations. each organization performs a 13-minute-long original show or a rendition of a popular show.
in spring 2010, greek sing raised over $42,000 for st. jude children's research. in 2022, welch house began to host the specialized queer community, a living community suited to the needs of non-binary students by allowing students to "live in the same room with any other student inclusive of sex assigned at birth, gender identity, gender expression, and/or sexual orientation". [161] welch house consists of semi-suite singles and doubles. in addition, stever house hosts an all-gender floor for students who would prefer a traditional double. spirit house is a residential community for upperclassmen designated for members of the spirit student organization, a black student union that serves as a haven for black students within the carnegie mellon community and champions issues facing the black community.
[162] the carnegie mellon tartans were a founding member of the university athletic association of ncaa division iii. prior to world war ii, carnegie mellon (as carnegie tech) played with what are now classified as ncaa division i teams. in 1936, the carnegie tech riflery team won the national intercollegiate championship. [163] the carnegie tech men's basketball team was a member of the eastern intercollegiate conference throughout the conference's existence from 1932 to 1939[164] and won the conference championship in 1936, defeating pittsburgh in a conference championship playoff game. [165] varsity teams are fielded in basketball, track, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming and diving, volleyball, tennis, and softball.
in addition, club teams exist in ultimate frisbee,[166] rowing,[167] rugby, lacrosse, hockey,[168] baseball,[169] softball, skiing & snowboarding,[170] soccer, volleyball, water polo,[171] and cycling. [172] carnegie mellon athletics runs a comprehensive and popular intramural system, maintains facilities (primarily skibo gymnasium, cohon university center, gesling stadium, and the future highmark center for health, wellness and athletics), and offers courses to students in fitness and sports. carnegie mellon's primary athletic rivals are fellow uaa schools case western reserve university and washington university in st. louis; the tartans had an especially intense rivalry with the latter's football team from the 2000s to 2017. on november 28, 1926, the 6–2 carnegie technical institute football team shut out the undefeated notre dame fighting irish 19–0 at forbes field. knute rockne, the coach of the irish at the time, was so confident that the irish would defeat "tiny carnegie tech" that he decided to skip the game and travel to chicago to watch the army-navy football game for scouting purposes. it was only later that he found out by telegram that the irish had suffered their first loss of the season.
espn compared the upset to the appalachian state victory over the university of michigan in 2007. [173] the game was ranked the fourth-greatest upset in college football history by espn. [174] since 2014, the tartans play in the presidents' athletic conference at the ncaa division iii level. the head coach of the football team is ryan larsen, who is currently the defending presidents' athletic conference coach of the year. prior to losing in the sweet 16 of this year's d3 playoffs, the tartans held a 17-game win streak which was, at the time, the longest win streak across all ncaa divisions in football.
in recent years, the varsity track and cross country programs have seen outstanding success on the division iii national level. the men's cross country team has finished in the top 15 in the nation each of the last three years, and has boasted several individual all-americans. the men's track team has also boasted several individual all-americans spanning sprinting, distance, and field disciplines. recent all-americans from the track team are bram miller (2021), tommy vandenberg (2014–2015), brian harvey (2007–2009), davey quinn (2007), nik bonaddio (2004, 2005), mark davis (2004, 2005), russel verbofsky (2004, 2005) and kiley williams. [175] carolyn lowe (10,000 meters 1992) is the only track athlete to win an ncaa division iii championship.
with much of the team's support, lauren schmidt received the ncaa pennsylvania woman of the year award (2003), was a two-time all-american (2001 and 2002), a four-time all-university athletic association selection (1999–2002), and the conference's player of the year (2001). [176] students can participate in any level of competition across multiple sports including wiffle ball, dodgeball, basketball, flag football, ultimate frisbee and many more. [177] there are more than 117,000 carnegie mellon alumni worldwide with the graduating class of 2022. [178] alumni and current/former faculty include 21 nobel laureates, six members of the national academy of medicine, 22 members of the national academy of sciences, 72 members of the national academy of engineering, two macarthur fellows, 24 guggenheim fellows, seven packard fellows, 142 emmy award recipients (including ten time recipient steven bochco), 12 academy award recipients, 52 tony award recipients, two winners of the stockholm prize in criminology, and 13 turing award recipients.

content from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_page: takin' it back is the fifth major-label studio album by american singer-songwriter meghan trainor. epic records released it on october 21, 2022. trainor worked with producers including federico vindver and gian stone and featured artists like teddy swims and natti natasha. inspired by the sound of her album title (2015) after its title track went viral on tiktok, takin' it back is a doo-wop and bubblegum-pop album about motherhood and self-acceptance. trainor promoted the latter with televised performances and two singles, "bad for me" and "made you look". the latter peaked at number 11 in the us and reached the top 10 in several other countries.
reviewers thought takin' it back showcased trainor's maturity, growth, and musicality, but they were divided on whether it was a progression from her earlier work. the album debuted at number 16 on the us billboard 200. its deluxe edition was supported by the single "mother". (this article is part of two featured topics: takin' it back and meghan trainor albums.) october 21 the 2017 american animated fantasy comedy-drama film coco won 63 awards from 81 nominations. produced by pixar animation studios and released by walt disney pictures, the film got particular recognition for its score, composed by michael giacchino (pictured).

(full list...) x-rays are a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, with wavelengths shorter than those of ultraviolet rays and longer than those of gamma rays – roughly in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometres.
x-rays were discovered by german scientist wilhelm röntgen in 1895, who named them x-radiation to signify an unknown type of radiation. x-rays can penetrate many solid substances such as construction materials and living tissue, and x-ray radiography is widely used in medical diagnostics. this medical significance was noticed by röntgen shortly after he discovered x-rays; this print, titled hand mit ringen (hand with rings), is a print of his first medical x-ray, taken of his wife anna bertha ludwig's hand in december 1895. print credit: wilhelm röntgen; restored by yann forget wikipedia is written by volunteer editors and hosted by the wikimedia foundation, a non-profit organization that also hosts a range of other volunteer projects: this wikipedia is written in english. many other wikipedias are available; some of the largest are listed below. content from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:contents: explore the vast knowledge of wikipedia through these helpful resources.

the flowers are pale pink to reddish-purple and are arranged in erect clusters surrounded by 4 green, egg-shaped involucral bracts 8–19 mm (0.31–0.75 in) long and 6–10.5 mm (0.24–0.41 in) wide. the bracts are green with a yellowish to reddish base. the floral tube is 9.5–15 mm (0.37–0.59 in) long and the sepals 2.5–4.0 mm (0.098–0.157 in) long, the stamens shorter than the sepals. flowering mainly occurs from september to december. [2][3][4] pimelea rosea was first formally described in 1810 by robert brown in his prodromus florae novae hollandiae et insulae van diemen.
[5][6] the specific epithet (rosea) means "rosy". [7] in 1999, barbara lynette rye described two subspecies of p. rosea in the journal nuytsia and the names are accepted by the australian plant census: subspecies rosea grows on sand dunes, coastal limestone and granite outcrops in woodland with tuart, and in winter-wet places, in near-coastal areas between lake pinjar and cheyne beach in the esperance plains, jarrah forest, swan coastal plain and warren bioregions of south-western western australia. [4][11] subspecies annelsii has a more inland distribution, growing in woodland, usually with marri and jarrah between mount barker, the junction of the hay and mitchell rivers, and narrikup in the jarrah forest bioregion. [4][9] rosea banjine is listed as "not threatened" by the western australian government department of biodiversity, conservation and attractions[2] but subsp. annelsii is listed as "priority three"[9] meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

pop. (2010) 305,704; pittsburgh metro area, 2,356,285; (2020) 302,971; pittsburgh metro area, 2,370,930. algonquian- and iroquoian-speaking peoples were early inhabitants of the region. the conflict between the british and french over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when general john forbes and his british and colonial army expelled the french from fort duquesne (built 1754). forbes named the site for the british statesman william pitt the elder. the british built fort pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the ohio.
settlers began arriving after native american forces led by ottawa chief pontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between native american groups and the penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended between pennsylvania and virginia. pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by john campbell in the area around the fort (now the golden triangle). following the american revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the ohio river. pittsburgh’s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. a blast furnace, erected by george anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city’s economic mainstay; by 1850 pittsburgh was known as the “iron city.” the pennsylvania canal and the portage railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping.
the city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire. after the american civil war, great numbers of european immigrants swelled pittsburgh’s population, and industrial magnates such as andrew carnegie, henry clay frick, and thomas mellon built their steel empires there. the city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the american federation of labor was born there in 1881. by 1900 the city’s population had reached 321,616. growth continued nearly unabated through world war ii, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. the population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. most citizens were still of european ancestry, but the growing african american proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth.
during the period of economic and population growth, pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. after the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. in 1957 it became the first american city to generate electricity by nuclear power. by the late 1970s and early ’80s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared—a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste by unemployment, becoming a symbol of the notorious rust belt, the u.s. region where steelmaking and manufacturing once thrived before succumbing to widespread unemployment and poverty.
pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industries—though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained important—and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and the service sector became increasingly important. pittsburgh long has been one of the nation’s largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportation centre. much of the golden triangle has been rebuilt and includes point state park (containing fort pitt blockhouse and fort pitt museum), the gateway center (site of several skyscrapers and a garden), and the david l. lawrence convention center. the university of pittsburgh was chartered in 1787. other educational institutions include carnegie mellon (1900), duquesne (1878), point park (1960), chatham (1869), and carlow (1929) universities and two campuses of the community college of allegheny county (1966).
central to the city’s cultural life is the carnegie museums of pittsburgh (formerly carnegie institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the carnegie science center (1991), which now also houses the henry buhl, jr., planetarium and observatory (1939), and the andy warhol museum (1994), which exhibits the works of the pittsburgh-born artist and filmmaker. other institutions affiliated with the organization are the carnegie library of pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 million volumes, and the carnegie music hall. the pittsburgh symphony orchestra performs at heinz hall, a restored movie theatre. phipps conservatory and botanical gardens (1893), which covers 15 acres (6 hectares), is noted for its extensive greenhouses.
the city’s zoo, in the northeastern highland park neighbourhood, includes an aquarium. two new sports venues opened in 2001 on the north bank of the allegheny opposite the golden triangle: pnc park is home of the pirates, the city’s professional baseball team, and acrisure stadium houses the steelers, its professional football team. the penguins, pittsburgh’s professional ice hockey team, plays at ppg paints arena. popular summertime attractions include riverboat excursions on pittsburgh’s waterways and kennywood, an amusement park southeast of the city in west mifflin. content from https://www.britannica.com/: this weekend marks a milestone homecoming celebration, as well as the anniversaries of two land deals that reshaped america’s map.
